# Modern Data Engineering GCP Project ~ Uber 

Welcome to the "Uber_data_engineering_project" repository! This open-source project is dedicated to exploring and performing data analytics on Uber data using a variety of cutting-edge tools and technologies. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive analysis using Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Python, Mage Data Pipeline Tool, BigQuery, and Looker Studio.

## Introduction

The project focuses on leveraging advanced data engineering techniques to analyze Uber data. We utilize GCP Storage, Python, Compute Instance, Mage Data Pipeline Tool, BigQuery, and Looker Studio to create a robust and efficient data analytics pipeline.

## Architecture 
Our architecture incorporates various technologies to ensure a seamless flow of data processing. The key components include Google Storage, Compute Instance, BigQuery, Looker Studio, and the modern data pipeline tool provided by Mage AI.
